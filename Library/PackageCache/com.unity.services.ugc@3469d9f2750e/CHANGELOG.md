## [0.0.3-preview] - 2022-02-18

### Added
- Added Tag support to `ContentDTO`. You can use `UGC.Instance.GetTags` to fetch all tags of a project. Tags are labels users can add to a content to help categorize it.
- Added `UGC.Instance.GetUserContentRating` to get the rating a player gave to a specific content.

### Changed
**BREAKING CHANGES**

- Renamed `GetContent` to `GetContents` for the version returning all the contents.
- Removed the `projectId` and `environmentId` parameters from all API methods. It now uses the project and environment the player is logged in to.
- Changed how to override the Environment used by the API, use `InitializationOptions.SetEnvironmentName` to specify the name, rather than the id of the environment you want to use.
- Renamed `ContentDTO.ContentId` to `ContentDTO.Id`.
- `ContentDTO.ReportsCount` is now null.
